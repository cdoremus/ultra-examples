### ðŸ’Ž Quickstart

#### A (mostly) blank project

```sh
git clone https://github.com/exhibitionist-digital/create-ultra-app
cd create-ultra-app
deno task dev
```

> If you want to dive right in,
> [create-ultra-app](https://github.com/exhibitionist-digital/create-ultra-app)
> is the easiest way. Less words, more ESM.

#### Steal this website

```sh
git clone https://github.com/exhibitionist-digital/ultra-examples
cd ultra-examples
deno task dev
```

More examples are found in the following branches in the ultra-examples repo:
`react-18`, `three-js`, `web3`

### [Anatomy of an Ultra project](#anatomy-of-an-ultra-project)

This is the bare minimum for an **Ultra** project.

- [server.ts](#serverts)
- [src/app.tsx](#srcapptsx)
- [importMap.json](#importmapjson)
- [deno.json](#denojson)

#### server.ts

This code runs Ultra's server:

```javascript
import ultra from "https://deno.land/x/ultra/server.ts";

await ultra();
```

#### importMap.json

Here we include the dependencies of the project:

```javascript
{
  "imports": {
    "react": "https://esm.sh/react@18",
    "react-dom": "https://esm.sh/react-dom@18",
    "react-dom/server": "https://esm.sh/react-dom@18/server",
    "react-helmet": "https://esm.sh/react-helmet-async?deps=react@18",
    "wouter": "https://esm.sh/wouter?deps=react@18",
    "swr": "https://esm.sh/swr?deps=react@18",
    "ultra/cache": "https://deno.land/x/ultra@v0.8.0/cache.js",
    "app": "./src/app.tsx"
  }
}
```

The above imports are all required to run **Ultra**. You can add other
dependencies here, and use the import keys as an import alias in your project
code
([see import maps section in the Deno manual](https://deno.land/manual/linking_to_external_code/import_maps)).

`app` is the entry point to your application. It can live anywhere in the `src`
directory. It can be `jsx` or `tsx`.

#### src

All of your project code should live in the `src` directory. The only
requirement is an `app.tsx/jsx` file, which is included in your importmap above.
Feel free to structure your project how you like. Static files (css, images,
etc) can be placed in this directory as well, and will be served as the `root`
of your domain.

#### src/app.tsx

```javascript
import React,  from "react";
import { SWRConfig } from "swr";
import { Link, Route, Switch } from "wouter";
import { Helmet } from "react-helmet";
import ultraCache from "ultra/cache";
import { Cache } from "https://deno.land/x/ultra/src/types.ts";

const options = (cache: Cache) => ({
  provider: () => ultraCache(cache),
  suspense: true,
});

export default const Ultra = ({ cache }: { cache: Cache }) => {
  return (
    <SWRConfig value={options(cache)}>
      <Helmet>
        <title>Ultra</title>
      </Helmet>
      <main>
        <Switch>
          <Route path="/">
            <h1>Homepage</h1>
          </Route>
          <Route>
            <h1>404</h1>
          </Route>
        </Switch>
      </main>
    </SWRConfig>
  );
};
```

1. File extensions are important. Always include `.tsx`/`.jsx` in your import
   statements.
2. The `ultraCache` function populates the server-side cache and rehydrates the
   client-side cache. It is not needed unless you are using Suspense or SWR.

#### deno.json

Using the native
[Deno config](https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/configuration_file),
ensure you specify your importMap path here, as well as any common tasks.

```javascript
{
  "tasks": {
    "dev": "mode=dev deno run -A --unstable --no-check server.js",
    "start": "deno run -A --unstable server.js",
    "cache": "deno cache --reload server.js",
    "vendor": "importMap=importMap.json deno run -A --unstable https://deno.land/x/ultra/vendor.ts",
  },
  "importMap": "importMap.json"
}
```

**Defined Tasks:**

- **dev** - Always forces re-importing of ESM files, enabled reload on save.
- **start** - Production mode that uses cached ESM imports.
- **cache** - Refreshes the deno cache for server.js.
- **vendor** - See [Vendoring](#vendoring) below.

---

### [Permissions](#permissions)

In production, instead of `-A`, define all the utilized permissions with
appropriate values to take full advantage of
[Deno's permission-based security](https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/permissions).
Ultra uses the following permissions: `allow-net`, `allow-read`, `allow-env`,
`allow-write`.

#### allow-env

Add these **Ultra** used environmental variables to the list of custom ones that
you use (in a comma-separated list):

<div class="envs">

- **mode**: (optional)\
  Deployment mode. `dev` is the value for local development (reload on save,
  non-caching of ESM imports). All other modes are considered production.

- **port**: `8000`\
  The port the server is run on.

- **source**: `src`\
  The name of the source directory.

- **root**: `http://localhost:8000`\
  The base url of your project.

- **lang**: `en`\
  The site's language, set as the `html lang`

- **disableStreaming**: (optional)\
  Whether streaming is disabled. Set to `1` to disable streaming.

</div>

#### allow-read

Add `./.ultra,./importMap.json` to the list of directories or files that you
use.

#### allow-write

Add `./.ultra` to the list of directories or files that you use.

#### allow-net

Add `https://deno.land/x/ultra/` to the list of internet Urls that you use.

### [Suspense data fetching](#suspense-data-fetching)

Vercel's [SWR](https://github.com/vercel/swr) lets us fetch data anywhere in our
components and works with Suspense. **Ultra** uses the brand new **SWR 1.0.0+**.

All **SWR** options are supported
[SWR docs](https://swr.vercel.app/docs/options#options).

```javascript
import { SWRConfig } from "swr";
import ultraCache from "ultra/cache";

const options = (cache) => ({
  provider: () => ultraCache(cache),
  suspense: true,
});

const Ultra = ({ cache }) => {
  return (
    <SWRConfig value={options(cache)}>
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
    </SWRConfig>
  );
};
```

---

### [Routing](#routing)

Powered by [Wouter](https://github.com/molefrog/wouter). **Wouter** is
fully-featured, tiny (1.36 KB), and the best React router that we've ever used.
**Ultra** comes with a server side integration which allows full functionality
of **Wouter**.

All **Wouter** hooks and functionality is supported
[Wouter docs](https://github.com/molefrog/wouter#wouter-api).

```javascript
import React, { Suspense } from "react";
import { Route } from "wouter";

const Home = lazy(() => import("./home.jsx"));

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Route path="/">
      <Home />
    </Route>
  );
};
```

---

### [Head](#head)

Powered by [react-helmet-async](https://github.com/staylor/react-helmet-async).
It is used to add markup to the `html` `<head>` element such as `<title>`,
`<meta>` and `<link>` tags.

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { Helmet } from "react-helmet";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Helmet>
      <title>Ultra</title>
    </Helmet>
  );
};
```

---

### [Service Workers](#service-workers)

We recommend the usage of vanilla **Service Workers** in your **Ultra** app. An
incredibly powerful tool to help with the serving, caching, and optimisation of
your website. Use them carefully.

[MDN Docs for Service Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API/Using_Service_Workers)

Here is an example that is currently used on this site:
[Ultrajs Service Worker](https://github.com/exhibitionist-digital/ultra-examples/blob/ultra-website/src/service-worker.js)

---

### [Dynamic MDX](#dynamic-mdx)

Ultra supports using MDX dynamically.

[MDX on demand](https://mdxjs.com/guides/mdx-on-demand/)

In fact,
[this very text](https://github.com/exhibitionist-digital/ultra-examples/blob/ultra-website/src/api/docs.js)
was generated with dynamic MDX.

We have a plugin that will make any of your local component imports work inside
of Ultra. This is how an basic API route could look...

#### MDX API route

```javascript
import { compile } from "https://esm.sh/@mdx-js/mdx";
import ultraMdx from "https://deno.land/x/ultra/ultraMdx.ts";

export default async () => {
  const source = await Deno.readTextFile(
    `${Deno.cwd()}/src/YOUR_MDX_FILE.mdx`,
  );

  const content = String(
    await compile(source, {
      outputFormat: "function-body",
      useDynamicImport: true,
      rehypePlugins: [ultraMdx],
    }),
  );
  const body = JSON.stringify({ content });
  return new Response(body);
};
```

#### MDX JSX template

```javascript
// Ensure you only import `run` to keep client size to a minimum
import { runSync } from "https://esm.sh/@mdx-js/mdx/run";
import * as runtime from "https://esm.sh/react@v18.0.0/jsx-runtime.js";

const Component = () => {
  // Fetch the content from the API route above
  const { data } = useSWR("/YOUR_API_ROUTE", fetcher);
  // and use runSync on it
  const { default: Content } = runSync(data.content, runtime);
  // Use Content like a standard React component
  return <Content />;
};
```

### [Vendoring](#vendoring)

During development, it's helpful to utilise CDNs like `esm.sh`, `unpkg.com`, and
`deno.land/x` to serve your projects dependencies. When deploying to production,
you may want to forego the CDNs and serve your dependencies locally. We have a
script for doing this encapsulated in the `vendor` task defined in `deno.json`:

```bash
importMap=importMap.json deno run -A --unstable https://deno.land/x/ultra/vendor.ts
```

This will download a complete graph of your dependencies to a `.ultra/x`
directory, as well as create a `vendorMap.json` import map file. You can then
define this new import map in your `deno.json` file to swap to local
dependencies.

> As of v0.8.0, all projects deployed to Deno Deploy will have this feature
> enabled by default.

---

### [Deploying](#deploying)

#### With Docker/Fly

`dockerfile`

This is an example dockerfile which supports vendored dependencies.

```bash
FROM denoland/deno:1.20.3
EXPOSE 8000
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y jq moreutils
WORKDIR /
COPY . .
RUN deno task vendor
RUN jq '.importMap = "./vendorMap.json"' deno.json|sponge deno.json
CMD ["deno", "task", "start"]
```

#### With Deno Deploy

**Ultra** supports the official
[Deno Deploy GitHub Action](https://deno.com/blog/deploy-static-files)!

1. Create a project in the Deno Deploy Dashboard
2. Select `GitHub Action` integration
3. Add the following action to your project. (Note to update the `root` and
   `project name`)

> Note: Deno Deploy does **NOT** support dynamic imports (yet). If you are using
> these for routing, the project will not deploy.

```yaml
name: deno deploy
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    name: deploy
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      id-token: write
      contents: read
    steps:
      - name: Clone repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Install Deno
        uses: denoland/setup-deno@main
        with:
          deno-version: 1.20.3

      - name: Build site
        run: root=https://example.com deno run -A https://deno.land/x/ultra/build.ts

      - name: Upload to Deno Deploy
        uses: denoland/deployctl@v1
        with:
          project: [PROJECT_NAME]
          entrypoint: ULTRA.js
          root: .ultra
```
